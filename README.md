# Basic HTML Website

Create simple HTML only website with multiple pages.

The project page URL is <https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website>.

This is my repository for this project. It is a very simple demo, without any CSS or JavaScript; it is pure HTML. However, I haven't implemented many functions.It's just a basic website. Most of the content is generated by "lorem", and the form on the Contact page doesn't work.

However, I think the purpose of this project for me has been fulfilled!

As you can see, my English is not very "native" or accurate. This is because I am Chinese, but I am trying my best to use English more and make it my work language in coding.
